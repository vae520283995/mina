    {[
      module Worker = Rpc_parallel.Make (T : Worker_spec)
    ]}

    The [Worker] module can be used to spawn new workers, either locally or remotely, and
    run functions on these workers. [T] specifies which functions can be run on a
    [Worker.t] as well as the implementations for these functions. In addition, [T]
    specifies worker states and connection states. See README for more details *)
