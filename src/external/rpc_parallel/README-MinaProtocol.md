# Changes for MinaProtocol

`rpc_parallel` was forked from `janestreet/rpc_parallel`. The first changes
for MinaProtocol were made atop tag v0.12.0 in branch `coda`. Bazel
support was added later.

For OCaml 4.11.2, the Jane Street code at v0.13.0 was merged into the fork.
Other than fixing minor merge conflicts, no other changes were made.
