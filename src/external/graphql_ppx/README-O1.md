# Changes for O(1)

`graphql_ppx` was forked from  `mhallin/graphql_ppx` at tag 0.2.9.
A number of changes were made atop that, including support for
compilation with Bazel.

For OCaml 4.11.2, some additional changes were made due to changes
in the OCaml AST structure.

The library has more recent versions than 0.2.9, but the code is
written in Reason, and not in OCaml.
